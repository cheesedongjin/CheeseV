# AGENT.md

This document defines essential rules that must be followed by the automation agent and all contributors to this project.

## 1. Never Ignore Code Comments
- All comments in the code are meaningful and **must never be ignored**.
- In particular, comments like "Never delete this comment" or "Do not insert manually" are strict directives and must be respected at all times.

## 2. Responsibilities of `generate_site.py`
- The following functions are responsible for building the site content and **must never be manually replicated**:
  - `build_site()`
  - `build_devlog()`
  - `build_portfolio()`

- These functions automatically handle tasks such as generating HTML files and copying content.  
  **Do not manually create, modify, or insert output files that are meant to be generated by these functions.**

- Manual intervention disrupts GitHub workflow and automation.  
  If changes are necessary, update the logic inside `generate_site.py` and allow it to handle the output.

## 3. General Principles
- Manual changes that conflict with the automated system are strictly prohibited.
- If automation logic is updated, clearly document the changes in pull request descriptions or commit messages.

## 4. Do Not Commit Auto-Generated Files
- **Files generated automatically by running scripts must not be committed to the repository.**
- These files are meant to be regenerated as needed and should be excluded from version control (e.g., via `.gitignore`).

## 5. Revert Auto-Modified Files
- If a script-run unintentionally modifies files that should remain untouched or are tracked manually,  
  **those changes must be reverted immediately** unless explicitly intended by the update logic.
- Always verify file changes after script execution and restore overwritten manual edits if necessary.
