    Hi, I'm Dongwook Lee â€” a self-taught developer based in South Korea.<br>
    I enjoy building things from scratch, exploring creative ideas through code, and turning concepts into working tools or games.<br>
    My focus areas include game development, automation, and systems programming, and I'm always learning new technologies through hands-on projects.
