<h1>CheeseV <span id="cheesev-hint" onclick="toggleCheeseV()">What's CheeseV?</span></h1>

<div id="cheesev-popup">
  <p><strong>CheeseV</strong> started as a typo — I accidentally typed a “V” after <em>cheese</em>, my favorite food.</p>
  <p>Instead of fixing it, I kept it. To me, it’s a reminder that small mistakes can lead to something meaningful.</p>
  <p>I don’t love cheese because it's the best-tasting food. I just like it — and that's enough.</p>
