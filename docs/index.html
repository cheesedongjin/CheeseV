<div id="cheesev-popup">
  <p><strong>CheeseV</strong> started as a typo — I accidentally typed a “V” after <em>cheese</em>, my favorite food.</p>
  <p>Instead of correcting it, I used it as the name of this project.</p>
  <p>I don’t have a particular reason for liking cheese — I just do.</p>

    Hi, I'm Dongwook Lee — a self-taught developer based in South Korea.<br>
    I build tools, systems, and games from scratch, often starting with small ideas and shaping them through code.<br>
    My current interests include game development, automation, and systems programming. I learn best by making things.
