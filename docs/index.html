    Hi, I'm Dongwook Lee â€” a self-taught developer based in South Korea.<br>
    I build tools, systems, and games from scratch, often starting with small ideas and shaping them through code.<br>
    My current interests include game development, automation, and systems programming. I learn best by making things.
