# AGENTS.md

This file contains additional guidelines for automated processes.

## Sitemap Commit Exception

Normally, auto-generated files must not be committed to the repository.
However, if the project owner explicitly authorizes modifications to
`AGENTS.md`, the automation workflow may commit `docs/sitemap.xml`
after the site is built.
