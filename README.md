Hi, I’m Dongwook Lee — a self-taught developer from South Korea.
I like turning ideas into small tools, games, and systems that work.

This site features:

* **DevLog** — thoughts and progress from personal projects
* **Web Portfolio** — selected works and interactive demos

Lately, I’ve been into game development, automation, and creative coding.
I enjoy building things that are simple, modular, and fun to extend.

> Still learning. Still making.
