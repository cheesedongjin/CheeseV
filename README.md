Hi, I'm Dongwook Lee — a self-taught developer based in South Korea.  
I enjoy building systems from the ground up, exploring creative ideas through code, and making small tools and games that solve real problems or simply bring joy.

This site includes:

- **DevLog** – short write-ups on ideas, experiments, and progress from my personal projects
- **Web Portfolio** – interactive demos and selected works

I'm currently focused on game development, automation, and creative coding.  
I like building things that are modular, extendable, and efficient — whether it’s a physics simulation, an indie game, or a productivity tool.

> Always learning. Always building.
