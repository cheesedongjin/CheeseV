# Dongwook Lee Portfolio

Hi, I'm Dongwook Lee â€” a passionate self-taught developer from South Korea. I love building games, automating systems, and exploring new ideas through code.

This repository powers my personal website. All posts and program descriptions are written in Markdown under the `content/` directory and rendered with a small Python script.

## Generating the Site

Run `python generate_site.py` to build the HTML files. The generated pages will appear in the `output/` folder.

Explore the website to see my latest blog posts and programs.
